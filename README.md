# pycsi
Tools for analysis of python code

## 3rd Party Package Notes

### pydeps

- Tons of command line options.
- Not entirely clear what this does or how, as the substantive parts seem highly dependent on python version.

### snakefood3

- File traversal and import extraction pretty similar to pycsi's first attempt, maybe a bit smarter and more elegant.
- Had a way of identifying built-in packages, though not poetry packages.
